CALCULATOR WEB APPLICATION
I recently developed a responsive and interactive calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to practice and reinforce my understanding of:
✅ DOM Manipulation
 ✅ Event Handling (Button & Keyboard Events)
 ✅ Input Parsing & Real-time Display
 ✅ Arithmetic Operations (+, −, ×, ÷)
 ✅ Error Handling (Invalid expressions, divide by zero)
 ✅ Keyboard Shortcuts (Enter, Backspace, Escape)
This project allowed me to implement clean UI design, responsive layout, and user-friendly features like operator correction, decimal precision, and keyboard accessibility — all from scratch without using any frameworks.
🔍 It’s a great example of how front-end skills and core JavaScript logic come together to build practical tools.
